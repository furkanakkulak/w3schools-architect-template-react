# React Architect Template Conversion

This project is a conversion of the W3Schools Architect Template from HTML/CSS to a React application. The HTML templates were transformed into JSX format, the page was divided into components, and data was dynamically generated using mapping techniques. Framer Motion library was integrated to add animations and effects.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- Vite: Fast build tool and development server.
- Framer Motion: Animation and motion library for React.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-architect-template`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

## Usage

This project demonstrates the process of converting an HTML/CSS template into a dynamic React application. It showcases the following:

- Converting HTML templates to JSX format.
- Breaking down the page into reusable components.
- Dynamically rendering data using mapping techniques.
- Adding animations and effects with Framer Motion.
- Utilizing TypeScript for static typing and enhanced code quality.

Feel free to explore the codebase, modify components, and experiment with different animations.
